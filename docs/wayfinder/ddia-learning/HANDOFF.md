# Handoff — DDIA interactive study notes (wayfinder map)

_Written 2026-08-27, updated after the Chapter 6 session. Continue by opening a session in `~/ddia`
(or anywhere) and saying `Use ~/ddia/docs/wayfinder/ddia-learning/HANDOFF.md`, then what to do
(e.g. "close ch4 and ch5, do chapter 6"). If a `wayfinder` skill is available, `/wayfinder MAP.md`
also works; otherwise read `MAP.md` + `tickets/` directly._

## What this effort is

Building one self-contained interactive HTML page per chapter of *Designing Data-Intensive
Applications* (Kleppmann, 1st ed.) with 2nd-edition updates folded in, for the user's personal
study. Everything canonical lives in the repo — read these rather than this doc:

- **Map (destination, notes, decisions, fog):** `~/ddia/docs/wayfinder/ddia-learning/MAP.md`
- **Tickets:** `~/ddia/docs/wayfinder/ddia-learning/tickets/` (local-markdown tracker:
  `Status:`, `Assignee:` = claim, `Blocked by:`; frontier = open + unblocked + unassigned)
- **Locked chapter template:** `~/ddia/docs/template.md` — page anatomy, ember=write/cyan=read
  color language, stepper mechanics (`data-on`/`data-hot` + `<ol class="cap">`), quiz format
- **Concept registry:** `~/ddia/concepts.json` — 169 slugs; anchors are
  `chNN-<slug>.html#<concept-slug>`; each chapter build fills its own `definition` fields
- **2nd-edition deltas per chapter:** `~/ddia/docs/wayfinder/ddia-learning/research/02-second-edition-deltas.md`
- **Book TOC with 0-based PDF page indexes:** `~/ddia/reference/toc.md`
- **Book PDF (gitignored):** `~/ddia/reference/ddia-1st-edition.pdf`; pypdf venv at `~/ddia/.venv/`
- **Remote:** https://github.com/NeoTheElder/ddia (private, user's personal account; `gh` is authed)

## State right now

Built chapters: **3 (pilot), 1, 2, 4, 5** closed on the map. **6 built and pushed, awaiting user
review** — ticket `09-chapter-06-partitioning.md` is claimed and open. User's pattern so far:
"close it, do the next chapter."

Remaining frontier after 6 closes: chapters 7–12 (tickets 10–15, in book order; user may name
a different one) and the **index page** (ticket 16 — `index.html` doesn't exist yet; stubs and
chapter footers already link to it).

Every unbuilt chapter has a stub HTML at its final filename, so cross-references never 404.

## How a chapter session runs (the recipe that has worked 4 times)

1. Claim the ticket (set `Assignee:`), commit.
2. Extract chapter text: `.venv/bin/python` + pypdf over the page range from `reference/toc.md`
   (write to the scratchpad, then Read it in two halves — ~80K chars).
3. `awk` the chapter's section out of the deltas research file.
4. Check slugs: the chapter's own (for `id=`s) and any cross-reference targets in `concepts.json`.
5. Write the body only (nav + `<main>` … `</main></div>`) to a scratch file.
6. Assemble by splicing ch03's head/CSS (title swapped) and its `<script>` tail verbatim —
   this guarantees template fidelity. Validate: HTML tag balance, each stepper's caption count
   ≥ max `data-on` step, every `href="chNN…#slug"` resolves to an existing file + registry slug.
7. Fill the chapter's `definition`s in `concepts.json`; commit; push; `open` the file.
8. User reviews → on "close it": set `Status: closed`, write the `## Resolution`, add a
   Decisions-so-far line to `MAP.md`, commit, push.

The assembly/validation Python is in the last few Bash calls of the previous session's
transcript and is short; re-derive from the description above if needed. Chapter pages weigh
100–135KB; the pilot and ch 2/ch 4 have 6 steppers, ch 1 has 2 — calibrate by mechanism density.

## Notes for Chapter 7 (next in order)

- PDF pages 242–263 (0-based); sections in `reference/toc.md`; 2nd ed = its Chapter 8.
- Existing forward links into ch 7 that must resolve: `#the-slippery-concept-of-a-transaction`
  (ch 5, ch 6), `#the-meaning-of-acid` (ch 6), `#single-object-and-multi-object-operations`
  (ch 6), `#weak-isolation-levels` and `#write-skew-and-phantoms` (ch 5), `#serializability`
  (ch 4). All slugs already exist in the registry.
- Ch 6 build notes for calibration: 150KB, 6 steppers (key-range hot spot, hash + compound key,
  local vs global secondary index, hash mod N, fixed-partition node join, request routing +
  ZooKeeper) + 5 static figures, 14-question quiz.
- **Visual QA is worth doing before the first push** — the ch 6 screenshots caught ~10 SVG
  text overflows/overlaps (captions running past x=680, step-N text still visible under step-N+1
  banners, filled highlight rects covering text). Rules of thumb: 9px mono ≈ 5.4px/char, so a
  caption starting at x=20 must be ≤ ~115 chars; give every per-step caption its own
  `data-on="N"` group rather than a range; use `fill="none"` + stroke for highlight boxes over
  text; never put `<em>`/`<strong>` inside SVG `<text>` (use `<tspan>`).
- Headless Chrome recipe: inject a script that isolates the target `.anim` in `<body>` and
  clicks `.next` N times, then `--headless=new --window-size=760,600 --screenshot` (fragment
  URLs and scrolling do NOT work for screenshots).
- `concepts.json` is serialized with `indent=1` — dump it that way to keep diffs small.

## Standing user preferences (also in the map's Notes)

- Enrichment passes are a standing, additive workflow: when the user's study flags a section
  needing more figures/steppers (first candidate: ch 3 "B-tree optimizations"), add them on
  request without reopening tickets or the template.
- No Jira, no Co-Authored-By trailers, plain commit messages. Commit + push after each step.
- Hosting is local `file://`; do not set up GitHub Pages unless asked.
- Wayfinder's one-ticket-per-session rule has been explicitly overridden by the user's
  repeated "keep going" — proceed chapter after chapter when told to.

## Suggested skills (call via the Skill tool)

- `wayfinder` — invoke with the map path to pick up / claim the next ticket properly.
- `frontend-design:frontend-design` and `artifact-diagramming` — the map's Notes name these for
  building chapter pages (design stance is already locked; load mainly for diagram discipline).
- `grilling` — only if the user raises a template-level question (structural changes go
  through a map decision, not ad-hoc drift).
